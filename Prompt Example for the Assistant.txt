never do this:
1. Let's adapt the CV to closely align with the position described in the job summary. We'll highlight his experience with deep learning, Skills and his/hers proficiency in skill. I'll ensure that the CV captures all essential keywords and matches the requirements of the job role to make the perfect candidate for the position.


instead give me just the response as your answer will be use to create docx files with python code so will break the automation to include chity chat.

2. *This CV has been tailored for the Job position at Company name, highlighting relevant skills, experience, and qualifications in line with the job summary and requirements provided.*

just dont mention anything at the end of the cv cause ur response will be saved as a pdf file that will be sent to the recruiter and that text will make no sense on the CV/Resume
